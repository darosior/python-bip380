# Bitcoin Script Descriptors, with Miniscript extension

## About

In Bitcoin, output [Script](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script)s are used to express the conditions
by which the amount associated with the output may be spent.

**Output Script Descriptors** are a simple language which can be used to describe such Scripts
generally and precisely.  Bitcoin Output Script Descriptors are defined in a set of
[BIP](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0001.mediawiki)s, the main one being
[bip-0380](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0380.mediawiki).

**Miniscript** is a language for writing (a subset of) Bitcoin Scripts in a structured way. It is an
extension to Output Script Descriptors and is currently only defined within P2WSH context.

Miniscript permits:
- To safely extend the Output Descriptor language to many more scripting features thanks to the
  typing system (composition).
- Statical analysis of spending conditions, maximum spending cost of each branch, security
  properties, third-party malleability.
- General satisfaction of any correctly typed ("valid") Miniscript. The satisfaction itself is
  also analyzable.
- To extend the possibilities of external signers, because of all of the above and since it carries
  enough metadata.

Miniscript guarantees:
- That for any statically-analyzed as "safe" Script, a witness can be constructed in the bounds of
  the consensus and standardness rules (standardness complete).
- That unless the conditions of the Miniscript are met, no witness can be created for the Script
  (consensus sound).
- Third-party malleability protection for the satisfaction of a sane Miniscript, which is too
  complex to summarize here.

This library provides an implementation of Segwit-native Output Descriptors and of Miniscript (to be
used within `wsh()` descriptors), with a minimal amount of dependencies.


## WIP: this is not ready for any real use!

This library is still a work in progress. It contains known bugs (in the satisfier or the
Taproot-Miniscript implementation for instance) and there are probably many unknown ones. See [this
issue](https://github.com/darosior/python-bip380/issues/27) for a discussion about the state of this
library.

Still, it's ready for hacking around and contributions are welcome. See the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/darosior/python-miniscript/issues) for ideas on where to start.
